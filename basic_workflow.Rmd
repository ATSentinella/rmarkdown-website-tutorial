title: "Basic workflow"
---

Building websites uses the same reproducible workflow you can use for your analyses and collaborations. It is very iterative. You can do it all from RStudio, with a combination of clicking or typing commands as you feel comfortable. 

1. add content (text, code, images, etc) in an RMarkdown file
1. knit the RMarkdown file 
1. update `_site.yml` (perhaps)
1. build the website
    - Build tab > Build Website or
    - in the console: `rmarkdown::render_site()`
1. repeat, repeat, repeat
1. commit and push your website to github, it's live!
1. repeat all of the above

Let's see what this looks like.

## RStudio landscape

Here is what you'll see when you've opened our `rmarkdown-website-tutorial` project in RStudio.  

The 'Build tab' will show up once RStudio knows your files can build a website, don't worry if you don't have it yet.  

If we open `Index.Rmd` we will see that it's all text with a bit of formatting. This top part is called the 'front matter'.

## Install the `rmarkdown` package

**Let's start by making sure you have the Build tab.** Install `rmarkdown` if you haven't already: 

```{r setup, eval= FALSE}
install.packages('rmarkdown')
library(rmarkdown) 
```
