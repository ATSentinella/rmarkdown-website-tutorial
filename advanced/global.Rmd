2016 marks the fifth year of annual global Ocean Health Index (OHI) assessments, with scores representing ocean health for 220 coastal nations and territories using the best available data each year.  


The OHI framework has not changed since its inception in 2012 ([*Halpern et al. 2012*](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v488/n7413/full/nature11397.html)). Goals are scored individually based on current status, trend, and external pressures and resilience measures for each coastal nation before being combined together. However, like any assessment methodology, the OHI benefits from constant evaluation and improvement aimed at incorporating new knowledge, data and understanding. For further information, see [*Halpern et al. 2015*](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117863) and [*Lowndes et al. 2015*](https://peerj.com/articles/1503).
