As the image above suggests, this is going to be iterative. Try changing a few things and reknitting a single page or rebuilding the whole site. Do your own thing, or here are a few things to try: 

## Change the website's theme

### Add a new page

### Center an image

### Add three columns

### Add a footer

1. move `./advanced/_footer.html` to `./_footer.html` (or create a new one)
2. uncomment
