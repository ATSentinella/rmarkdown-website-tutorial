As the image above suggests, this is going to be iterative. Try changing a few things and reknitting a single page or rebuilding the whole site. Do your own thing, or here are a few things to try: 

<br> 

### Add a new page

<br>

### Move `_site.R`

`_site.R` should be in the main repo folder, not in the advanced folder. Move it there and update all filepaths that depend on it (e.g. look in `getting_sophisticated.Rmd` or try to build).

<br> 

### Center an image

<br> 

### Add three columns

<br> 

### Add a footer

1. move `./advanced/_footer.html` to `./_footer.html` (or create a new one)
2. uncomment
