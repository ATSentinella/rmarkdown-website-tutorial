title: "First Observations"

**Here's the plan**:

The easiest to learn from a working example, so let's explore this repo. We are going to start online, then clone the repo and explore by going back and forth between the R Markdown editor and the built pages.

## Explore first on GitHub

Note the url of this website: <http://jules32.github.io/rmarkdown-website-tutorial>. This means that there is a folder called `rmarkdown-website-tutorial` in `jules32`'s Github account, so let's head to <https://github.com/jules32/rmarkdown-website-tutorial>.

Note: you can have github websites point to a different url you have purchased.

Notice the `gh-pages` branch

Notice the filenames, similar but also _site.yml



## Fork to your account, clone to your computer
