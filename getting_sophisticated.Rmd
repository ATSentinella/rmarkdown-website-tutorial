We're only covering a few possibilites here; see [RStudio's R Markdown lessons](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) for the complete picture.

<br>

**First off**, note that on this page: 

1. there is a Table of Contents (TOC) there on the left, and 
1. it is floating (i.e. it follows you as you scroll down and expands/collapses nicely as you click)
1. This is all done in the front matter:  
```
    output:  
      html_document:  
        toc: true  
        toc_float: true  
```  
<!---also note that my numbering in this list renders nicely--->

## Simple styling

Disclaimer: Most of what is here I figured out through Googling and trial and error...so there are most definitely better and more elegant ways to do this. But here are some ideas using CSS and HTML. 

### images

**Resize** an image using HTML tags (side note: check out [RStudio's R Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)):

<img src="images/Rmd_cheatsheet.png" width="350px">

<img src="images/Rmd_cheatsheet.png" width="150px">

  
**Align** an image using HTML tags: 

`<center> and </center>:` 

<center><img src="images/Rmd_cheatsheet.png" width="150px"></center>

`<div align="right"> and </div>:`

<div align="right"><img src="images/Rmd_cheatsheet.png" width="150px"></div>

<br> 


### columns
 
<!---From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31753897/2-column-section-in-r-markdown:
Put in your css file or directly in rmarkdown--->
<style>
  .col2 {
    columns: 2 200px;         /* number of columns and width in pixels*/
    -webkit-columns: 2 200px; /* chrome, safari */
    -moz-columns: 2 200px;    /* firefox */
  }
</style>
 

<div class="col2">
**Column 1**

- note `<div class="col2">` and `</div>`
- what beautiful bullet points
<br>
<br>

**Column 2**

- I have 3 bullet points here
- which means to align with the left column
- I added a `<br>` there
</div>

<br>

<center>
**Here the text is centered. Here are good resources:**

• [w3schools.com - HTML references](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/) • [w3schools.com - CSS tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/css/) • 
</center>

<br>

### colored text

`<font> and </font>`

<font size="3" color="red">This is red text size 3!</font>  
<font size="2" color="blue">This is blue text size 2!</font>  
<font face="verdana" color="green">This is green text in verdana!</font>

## Themes

We can change the website's theme in `_site.yml`. Explore options here: <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html#appearance_and_style>:

>Valid themes include "default", "cerulean", "journal", "flatly", "readable", "spacelab",  "united", "cosmo", "lumen", "paper", "sandstone", "simplex", and "yeti".

## `R` code

You can execute R code each time you build your website. Even if you don't yet know R, this is a little taste of the types of things you can do. There are two ways you'll see R code; in-line and in a code chunk. 

![](images/markdown_rmarkdownlesson-4.png)

<br>

### in line

Here is an example inline. The date when I last built the website is `r Sys.Date()`. My favorite number is `r pi + 10`. There are `r length(list.files())` files and folders in our repo. This is not just text; his is executable R code that is `r 10 * 10`% awesome!

<br>

### in a code chunk

And here is an example of a code chunk. Let's plot the first bit of an `iris` variable (which is a dataset that comes with base R). 

```{r plot iris}
x <- iris$Sepal.Length[1:15]
plot(x)
```

### calling another file 

#### `R` script

You can source an R script. For example, 

```{r plot, echo=T, warning=FALSE, message=F}
## source an external script
source("advanced/my_script.R")

## plot the `data_from_my_script` variable, which is data from `my_script.R`
ggplot(data = data_from_my_script, aes(x = year, y = pop)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = data_from_my_script$country)
```

<br>

#### `_site.R`

Will give you 'global variables' that will be available across your site.

```{r _site.R, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=F}
source("_site.R")
```
 
<br>

#### `Rmd` file 

You can insert separate R Markdown files by identifying a 'child' file to this 'parent file. In the code chunk below, we'll say `{r, child='advanced/important_example.Rmd'}`. This will insert our important example seamlessly and is a super powerful way to reduce copy-pasting in your analyses.

```{r, child='advanced/important_example.Rmd'}
```

## Troubleshooting

You'll get errors as you work; this is how you learn. These are a few things you may encounter: 

1. If when running `rmarkdown::render_site()` you get this error: 

    ```
    Error in object[seq_len(ile)] : 
    object of type 'symbol' is not subsettable
    ```
Go to *Session > Restart R* and try again. 

2. When knitting, if you get this error: 

    ```
    Error in parse_block(g[-1], g[1], params.src) : duplicate label 'setup'
    Calls: <Anonymous> ... process_file -> split_file -> lapply -> FUN -> parse_block
    Execution halted
    ```
Here you have 2 `R` code chunks named the same thing (in this case 'setup'), you must change one of them because there cannot be two code chunks with the same name.


3. When you get an error message you don't understand: Copy-paste it into Google.
