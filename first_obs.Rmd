## Explore first on GitHub

Note the url of this website: <http://jules32.github.io/rmarkdown-website-tutorial>. This means that there is a folder called `rmarkdown-website-tutorial` in jules32's Github account, so let's head to <https://github.com/jules32/rmarkdown-website-tutorial>.

Notice the `gh-pages` branch

## Fork to your account, clone to your computer
